    "# First Look at Imaging\n",
    "\n",
    "## About this Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide features [CARTA](https://cartavis.org/), the “Cube Analysis and Rendering Tool for Astronomy,” which is the new NRAO visualization tool for images and cubes. The CASA viewer ([imview](https://casadocs.readthedocs.io/en/v6.6.1/api/tt/casaviewer.imview.html)) has not been maintained for a few years and will be removed from future versions of CASA. We strongly recommend using CARTA, as it provides a much more efficient, stable, and feature rich user experience. A comparison of the CASA viewer and CARTA, as well as instructions on how to use CARTA at NRAO, is provided in the [CARTA section of the CASA docs](https://casadocs.readthedocs.io/en/v6.6.1/notebooks/carta.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a first look at imaging ALMA\n",
    "data for those new to CASA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data delivered by ALMA is pre-calibrated either by ARC staff or by the\n",
    "ALMA calibration pipeline. The delivered data is ready for imaging. This\n",
    "tutorial demonstrates the basic procedures that will help you complete\n",
    "the imaging steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide covers the same material used in hands-on training sessions\n",
    "at [NRAO Community Days\n",
    "events](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/alma/naasc-workshops/facilities/alma/community)\n",
    "and ALMA Data Reduction tutorials presented by NAASC staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting CASA\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not already have CASA installed on your machine, you will have\n",
    "to download and install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download and installation instructions are available here:\n",
    "\n",

    "## About the Sample Data: Continuum and N2H+ in TW Hydra\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this example comes from ALMA Project 2011.0.00340.S,\n",
    "\"Searching for H2D+ in the disk of TW Hya v1.5\", for which the PI is\n",
    "Chunhua Qi. Part of the data for this project has been published in\n",
    "\\[<http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013Sci>...341..630Q Qi et al. 2013\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "The original observation had three scientific objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Image the submm continuum structure in TW Hydra\n",
    "2.  Image the H2D+ line structure (rest frequency 372.42138 GHz)\n",
    "3.  Image the N2H+ line structure (rest frequency 372.67249 GHz)\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in our tutorial has already been calibrated. Furthermore,\n",
    "to make the data set more manageable, we have reduced it in size by\n",
    "averaging in time and frequency. Our goal will be to image the continuum\n",
    "emission and the N2H+ spectral line, which is bright and well suited for\n",
    "demonstrating the imaging techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectral window we will image covers 234.375 MHz in bandwidth, and\n",
    "contains 384 channels spaced by 610 kHz. The data includes observations\n",
    "from 19 of the ALMA 12-m main array antennas, observed during Early\n",
    "Science Cycle 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this tutorial is part of a larger data package used for\n",
    "NRAO calibration and imaging tutorials. If you plan on working through\n",
    "all of the \"First Look\" tutorials for CASA beginners, it is worth\n",
    "downloading the entire package now. If you plan on working through just\n",
    "this imaging tutorial then you can download a smaller data package (see\n",
    "below).\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete package (1.8G tarred and zipped, 2.6G unpacked) is\n",
    "available here:\n",

    "Now we will use the task  to do the imaging. Here is an explanation of\n",
    "how we set some of the parameters; see the documentation for a complete\n",
    "list of  options.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - We will first image the phase calibrator, and set the image name to\n",
    "    \"phase\\_cal\". To identify the phase calibrator in a measurement set,\n",
    "    look at the 'ScanIntent' column in the output of . The phase\n",
    "    calibrator should have the intent \"CALIBRATE\\_PHASE\\#ON\\_SOURCE\". In\n",
    "    this MS, the phase calibrator is J1037-295, identified by field =\n",
    "    \"3\".\n",
    "  - We will use multifrequency synthesis (specmode = mfs) to make a\n",
    "    single continuum image. Multifrequency synthesis combines data from\n",
    "    all selected spectral channels into a single continuum image. If\n",
    "    your observations cover a large frequency range, it is possible that\n",
    "    the amplitude or structure of the source can change substantially\n",
    "    with frequency. This is only a concern if the fractional bandwidth\n",
    "    (delta\\_nu/nu\\_center) is greater than 10%. For this dataset it is\n",
    "    not an issue. Therefore, we set deconvolver=hogbom, which uses\n",
    "    nterms=1, telling tclean that each deconvolved component has a\n",
    "    single amplitude at all frequencies.\n",
    "  - We will image a single pointing, so we set gridder='standard'. If we\n",
    "    had multiple, contiguous pointings-- or if we were simultaneously\n",
    "    imaging 7m and 12m array data (even if only a single pointing of\n",
    "    each)--- we would need to set gridder='mosaic'.\n",
    "  - We set the cell size to 0.1 arcseconds, which places \\~5 pixels\n",
    "    across the synthesized beam. As a rule of thumb, we'd like \\~5\n",
    "    pixels across the smallest direction of our elliptical beam. For a\n",
    "    small dataset, you may be able to determine a good cell size with a\n",
    "    quick imaging call, and note the beam calculated by tclean. For many\n",
    "    ALMA projects, however, this could take a substantial amount of\n",
    "    time\\! You can estimate what the cell size should be by looking\n",
    "    again at the uv-coverage. Change the x-axis to uvwave, and the cell\n",
    "    size is roughly 206265/(longest baseline in wavelengths)/(number of\n",
    "    cells across the beam). For this MS, this works out to 0.09\", which\n",
    "    we round up to 0.1\". As you will see, tclean reports a synthesized\n",
    "    beam size of 0.51\" x 0.42\", making this a decent choice.\n",
    "  - We choose the image size then based on the cell size. We want our\n",
    "    image to cover the primary beam of a single antenna. For single\n",
    "    fields with the 7m antennas, the primary beam in arcseconds is \\~\n",
    "    10608/nu\\_GHz, where nu\\_GHz is the central frequency expressed in\n",
    "    GHz, and for single fields with the 12m antennas, the primary beam\n",
    "    in arcseconds is \\~ 6300/nu\\_GHz. The TW Hya data were taken with\n",
    "    12m antennas at a central frequency of 372.650 GHz, giving a primary\n",
    "    beam of about 17\". (For point sources, full coverage of the primary\n",
    "    beam becomes less important, especially for well-known calibrators,\n",
    "    and so you might see in the weblogs for your data that calibrator\n",
    "    images are a bit smaller than the primary beam estimate would\n",
    "    suggest. This is to save disk space and processing time during\n",
    "    pipeline runs\\!)\n",
    "  - Image sizes can be arbitrary but should be symmetrical. Good\n",
    "    practice is probably to round up to the nearest 10 or 100 pixels and\n",
    "    if tclean does not like your choice, it will recommend in the logger\n",
    "    window a better choice. The size of the primary beam suggests an\n",
    "    image size then of 17\"/0.1 arcsec per cell = 170 cells. Note that\n",
    "    with this image size, however, tclean will warn that there is a\n",
    "    non-zero value at the edge of the primary beam. For well-known\n",
    "    calibrators, this is likely not an issue, but we'll increase the\n",
    "    image size here just to demonstrate. At a size of 245 x 245, the\n",
    "    non-zero value warning goes away, but now tclean suggests a more\n",
    "    efficient image size of 250 rather than 245. Thus we will use an\n",
    "    image size of 250x250 cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "The  task will start in interactive mode, which allows you to manually\n",

    "So far we have mostly followed an interactive process with tclean.\n",
    "tclean can also be set up to run without interactive guidance. The three\n",
    "main parameters to specify are the threshold at which to stop (when the\n",
    "maximum residual in the tclean region is lower than this threshold,\n",
    "tclean stops), the mask (the region in which tclean is willing to\n",
    "identify signal), and the maximum number of iterations. The max\n",
    "iterations is not strictly required and it is generally recommended that\n",
    "it be used as more of a failsafe. That is, set it to a number so high\n",
    "that if tclean gets there something has gone wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's take a stab at determining a clean mask. Look at the image\n",
    "you just made. All of the obvious emission is contained in a box that is\n",
    "bounded by pixel numbers in a range of something like (100,100) to\n",
    "(150,150). We'll set that box to be a mask using the \"mask\" parameter in\n",
    "the call to tclean. You could also set it by supplying a file (for\n",
    "example the one created from your earlier interactive version of\n",
    "tclean).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's determine a stopping threshold for tclean. Again, look at the\n",
    "previous image using CARTA and draw a box well away from the source to\n",
    "estimate the noise. Like before, look at the 'Statistics' tab in the\n",
    "'Regions' box of the interface to find the RMS noise. We see something\n",
    "like \\~7 mJy/beam. Set the threshold to be about twice this, \\~15\n",
    "mJy/beam. A clean threshold several times the rms noise is usually\n",
    "recommended to avoid adding false sources to the deconvolved image. That\n",
    "is, you do not want tclean to treat a random noise spike as a source and\n",
    "deconvolve it from the image. This can be particularly problematic if\n",
    "you are doing self-calibration (a later lesson). Finally set\n",
    "niter=10000, which is a lot of iterations. We expect tclean to terminate\n",
    "before reaching this. For our purposes this is just a big number that's\n",
    "designed to keep tclean from running forever."
